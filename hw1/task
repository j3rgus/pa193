Homework

* write an example program with an *integer overflow* (2pt)
* use the overflowing number as an `alloca` parameter
* this introduces a *stack-based* vulnerability
* use your knowledge about stack exploits from *first week*
* provide a file with input that *exploits the vulnerability* (2pt)
* compile your code without ASLR, stack guard, etc.
* use return address overwrite in your exploit (2pt)
* write a text message explaining what you did (~2 pages)
* also describe how to fix the vulnerability you introduced
